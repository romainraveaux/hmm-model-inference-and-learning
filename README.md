Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for Named-Entity Recognition (NER)
Goals :
1. A presentation of HMM
2. Formal definitions on inference and learning with HMM
3. An application Named-Entity Recognition (NER)

Conclusion
1. We have implemented a Hidden Markov Model for named-entity recognition.
2. The learning phase is achieved by modeling probability distributions as categorical distributions and parameters of these distructions are learned by Maximum Likelihood.
3. Inference is achieved by Maximum a posteriori thanks to the Viterbi algorithm

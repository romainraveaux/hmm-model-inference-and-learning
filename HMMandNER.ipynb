    "Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as (named) entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction) is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.\n",

    "1. We just give a sequence (x) and output the labeled sequence (y)\n",
    "2. Where learning can be introduced ?\n",
    "3. Where are the parameters ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning\n",
    "1. Relatively simple. We first isolate the part of the model that we want to learn : $Pr(x_i|y_i;\\lambda)$ and $Pr(y_i|y_{i-1};\\gamma)$. For example, we might learn the parameters $\\lambda$, $\\gamma$ from paired examples of $x_i$ and $y_i$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. We model $Pr(x_i|y_i)$ as being categorically distributed, where the parameters depend $y_i$, so that $Pr(x_i|y_i)=Cat_{x_i}[\\lambda]$. Categorical distribution is well suited for words because words are by definition categorial values.  $\\lambda \\in [0, 1]^{K \\times D}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. We model $Pr(y_i|y_{i-1})$ as being categorically distributed, where the parameters depend on the previous sign $y_{i-1}$\n",
    "so that $Pr(y_i|y_{i-1}=k)=Cat_{y_i}[\\gamma]$.  In our case, $\\gamma \\in [0, 1]^{K \\times K}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recall on the categorical distribution\n",
    "$y_i \\in \\mathcal{E}$ is a named-entity. K=$|\\mathcal{E}|$ is the number of named-entities.\n",
    "$Pr(y_i)=Cat_{y_i}[\\theta]$\n",
    "The probabilities of observing the K outcomes are held in a $K \\times 1$ parameter vector $\\theta = [ \\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\cdots, \\theta_K]$, where $\\theta_k \\in [0, 1]$ and $\\sum_{k=1}^K \\theta_k =1$\n",

    "Alternatively, we can think of the data as taking values $y_i \\in \\{e^{(1)}, \\cdots, e^{(k)} \\}$ where $e^{(k)}$ is the $k^{th}$ unit vector; all elements of $e^{(k)}$ are zero except the $k^{th}$, which is one (i.e. $e^{(2)} = [0,1,0,0,0]$ and $e^{(2)}_1=0$). \n",

    "### A non-positional model\n",
    "We model $Pr(x_i|y_i)$ as we would do it in Natural Language Processing or Computer Vision fields. It means that we are thinking in terms of a time invariant model. $Pr(x_i|y_i)$ does not depends on the time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of the HMM : \n",
    "1. Markov Assumption : The future depends only on the present. Also known as firs order Markov chain\n",
    "2. It is a generative model. We want to predict $y_i$ and instead we generate $x_i$\n",
    "3. $Pr(x_i|y_i)$ and $Pr(y_i|y_{i-1})$ holds parameters that are shared through time. All time steps have the same parameters. Corresponding to the assumption of a stationary time series.\n",
